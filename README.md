# Beatport-Yearly-Chart-Compiler
Compiles a "Best of Year XXXX" from the bptoptracker archives.
The bptoptracker genre list has not been updated since some time in 2017, so some genres such as Afro-House are not obtainable.

Incredibly simple to use, simply follow the prompts! 


Should there be a problem, or just something you want to say, do not hesitate to send me a message!

Regards,

Von Knudsen.

Features modified in first revision:
- Added nice, user friendly prompts.
- Introduced a bit of tolerance in structure when reading from bptoptracker, allowing for instances such as no BPM to be processed, and not bring up tons of errors.

Features added in second revision:
- There was a lot of user input for even the smallest of things, like how many days in a year there were. Removed that. 
- Changed how a few of the functions were called, allowing room for the other version of this code, that downloads all the genres in one go, to come to be.
-Provided the option to download the Top-100 chart.
